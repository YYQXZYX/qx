<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>
<img src=
<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>

<p>Walla Walla, WA</p>
<p>Magic City, ID</p>
<p>Bountiful, UT</p>
<p>Last Chance, CO</p>
<p>Truth or Consequences, NM</p>
<p>Why, AZ</p>
<h2>July 14, 2012</h2></p>
<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

<p>Passing cars, </p>
<p>When you can't see, </p>
<p>get you, </p>
<p>A glimpse, </p>
<p>Of eternity. </p>
<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

<p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go
. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>

<p>cellphone</p>
<p>iPod</p>
<p>digital camera</p>
<p>and a protein bar</p>
<p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins with on</p>
